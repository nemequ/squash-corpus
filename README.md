# Squash Compression Corpus

Note, the name is not final.

I've been working on benchmarking lately, and it seems to me that
our current data sets are pretty inadaquate.  That thought has
really been gnawing at me ever since I read [a post by Charles
Bloom](http://encode.ru/threads/1117-LZHAM?p=42326&viewfull=1#post42326),
and now I'm thinking that I should stop thinking about it and
actually do something about it, so I'm considering putting
together a new corpus.  I'd like to do this openly.

First off, everything would have to be redistributable.  I think
an open-source style license could be detrimental here, but I
also don't think it would be necessary.  As long as people can
redistribute the files for benchmarking purposes I think people
will be happy, and if we don't grant the right to incorporate the
content into their own product I think we might be able to get
some decent data which might otherwise not be released.  That
said, if we can use open-source content I think it would be nice.

So the question is what should be included?  I'm really looking
for suggestions here, please use the issue tracker.  Meanwhile,
I'll file issues with my ideas, and hopefully we can start
narrowing in on some content.
